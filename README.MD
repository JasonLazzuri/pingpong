## Description

_{This Webpage will ask you to input a number (between 1 and 10000) and it will first put that number into an array. Then it will check the array to see if any numbers are divisible by 3, and those numbers will change to the word "ping". It will then look for numbers that are divisible by 5 and change those numbers to the word "pong". Lastly it will look for letters divisible by 15 and replace those numbers with "ping-pong" [link](https://jasonlazzuri.github.io/pingpong/) }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_{Open the Webpage and click in the box, type in a number between 1 to 10000, then click submit.}_

## Known Bugs

_{The input box does not take "," at this time. If you input a comma it will not work. The first "3" is not taken out- instead the word ping is added, I'm not sure why.Those are the only known bugs I know at the moment, if you find any more please feel free to contact me.}_
